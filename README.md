## Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced media environment, misinformation spreads rapidly, especially during live broadcasts. The challenge of detecting false information in real time is critical for broadcasters, journalists, and viewers alike.

---

## Project Overview

**Certa** is an advanced AI-powered real-time misinformation detection system specifically designed for live broadcasts. The project aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of information shared during live media events by providing immediate alerts regarding potential false information.

---

## Key Objectives

- Enhance information accuracy by automatically flagging potentially false claims with high confidence levels  
- Provide real-time alerts for broadcasters  
- Deliver an interactive and user-friendly dashboard for monitoring flagged content  
- Analyze potential consequences of misinformation  
- Recommend corrections and improvements for information sources  

---

## Key Features

1. **Social Media Analysis Engine**  
   - Monitor trends across platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok  
   - Detect misinformation patterns before viral spread  
   - Advanced social graph and sentiment analysis  

2. **Impact Analysis System**  
   - Assess misinformation effects in areas like health, politics, and economics  
   - Model spread patterns using network theory  

3. **Deepfake Detection Module**  
   - Identify tampered audio, video, and image content  
   - Detect inconsistencies and synthetic manipulations  

4. **Explainable AI (XAI)**  
   - Provide transparent model decision-making processes  
   - Visualize confidence scores and reasoning paths  

5. **Source Credibility and Correction Framework**  
   - Evaluate reliability of information sources  
   - Suggest credible alternatives and correction templates  

6. **Continuous Learning System**  
   - Adaptive feedback loops for ongoing model improvement  
   - Incorporation of user reports and fact-checking feedback  

7. **Mobile Application Integration**  
   - On-the-go misinformation detection and verification  
   - User-friendly mobile interface
